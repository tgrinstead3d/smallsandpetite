# Case Study: Smalls & Petite Website Redesign

## Project Overview
**Smalls & Petite** is a personalized yard sign business specializing in illustrative themes for birthdays, showers, and announcements. This project involved a complete redesign and migration of their existing website to a modern, custom-built platform.

## The Challenge
The primary catalyst for this project was the client's decision to move from their previous hosting service. This migration presented a perfect opportunity to not just move the site, but to streamline the user experience and renew the brand's digital presence.

The client specifically requested a design that conveyed an **"upper middle class"** aesthetic. They wanted to move away from a generic look to something more established, premium, and trustworthy, while maintaining the joy and celebration central to their business.

## The Solution
We designed and developed a custom web application using **Nuxt 3 (Vue.js)**. The new site focuses on a clean, sophisticated visual language that elevates the brand.

### Key Design Features
*   **Premium Aesthetic**: We implemented a specific color scheme featuring muted greys (`#757472`, `#5f5d5b`), crisp whites, and soft background textures to achieve the desired "upper middle class" feel.
*   **Typography**: A careful selection of fonts creates a hierarchy of elegance and readability:
    *   *Satisfy* for playful, celebratory headings.
    *   *Relation One* and *Relation Two* for sophisticated section titles.
    *   *Proxima Nova* for clean, modern body text.
*   **Glassmorphism & Depth**: Subtle box shadows and semi-transparent backgrounds give the interface a modern, layered depth without feeling cluttered.
*   **Visual Storytelling**: A custom hero slideshow and high-quality imagery showcase the product in real-world settings, helping customers visualize the signs in their own yards.

### Technical Implementation
*   **Framework**: Built with **Nuxt 3**, ensuring high performance, SEO optimization, and a smooth single-page application (SPA) experience.
*   **Styling**: utilized **Scoped Vanilla CSS** to build a custom design system from the ground up, avoiding the "cookie-cutter" look of CSS frameworks.
*   **Performance**: Implemented font preloading and image optimization to ensure fast load times, crucial for mobile users.
*   **Mobile Responsiveness**: The site is fully responsive, offering a seamless experience on smartphones and tablets—a critical requirement for busy parents and event planners on the go.

## Outcome
The new Smalls & Petite website successfully positions the brand as a premium service provider. The streamlined navigation and "Shop by Occasion" structure make it easier for customers to find exactly what they need, while the refined aesthetic builds trust and aligns with the client's vision of an established, high-end business.
